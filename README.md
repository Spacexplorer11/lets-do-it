# Let's do it!
## What's this?
Let's do it is a Rust CLI tool for your to-do tasks. 
As of now, it doesn't have much uniqueness, its just your run-of-the-mill CLI to-do list.
It does now save your tasks in tasks.txt so they persist between runs!
Simple functions:
- Add
- Update
- Delete
- List
- Help  

Nothing else at the moment.  
However, I have planned to allow single-liners like ldt --list, 
or something like cargo run -- --list. I'll use clap (the library) for this.

## What libraries do I use?
Check cargo.toml!  
But right now, I use rustyline for input, and indexmap for well the IndexMap.


## How can I use it?
Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/lets-do-it/releases/latest) for your OS from the Github Releases!  
Rust compiles to native binaries making it super simple for you!
